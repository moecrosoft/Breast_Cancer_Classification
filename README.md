# Breast Cancer Classification

In this project, neural networks were built and trained using PyTorch to classify tumors in the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset as malignant or benign. Experimentation with the **Iris dataset** for multi-class classification to explore how the same approach works on different types of data.

The project covers the full workflow: preparing the data, designing and training the network, and evaluating it using metrics like training/test loss and confusion matrices. Different optimizers and hidden layer sizes were used to see how they affect performance.
